* 1.0+beta2 (07/03/2017)

- Simplified the rules for finding the root of the workspace as the
  old ones were often picking up the home directory. New rules are:
  + look for a =jbuild-workspace= file in parent directories
  + look for a =jbuild-workspace*= file in parent directories
  + use the current directory

- Fixed the expansion of =${ROOT}= in actions

- Install =quick-start.org= in the documentation directory

- Add a few more things in the log file to help debugging

* 1.0+beta1 (07/03/2017)

- Added a manual

- Support incremental compilation

- Switched the CLI to cmdliner and added a =build= command
  (#5, Rudi Grinberg)

- Added a few commands:
  + =runtest=
  + =install=
  + =uninstall=
  + =installed-libraries=
  + =exec=: execute a command in an environment similar to what you
    would get after =jbuilder install=

- Removed the =build-package= command in favor of a =--only-packages=
  option that is common to all commands

- Automatically generate =.merlin= files
  (#2, Richard Davison)

- Improve the output of jbuilder, in particular don't mangle the
  output of commands when using =-j N= with =N > 1=

- Generate a log in =_build/log=

- Versioned the jbuild format and added a first stable version.
  You should now put =(jbuilder_version 1)= in a =jbuild= file at the
  root of your project to ensure forward compatibility

- Switch from =ppx_driver= to =ocaml-migrate-parsetree.driver=. In
  order to use ppx rewriters with Jbuilder, they need to use
  =ocaml-migrate-parsetree.driver=

- Added support for aliases
  (#7, Rudi Grinberg)

- Added support for compiling against multiple opam switch
  simultaneously by writing a =jbuild-worspace= file

- Added support for OCaml 4.02.3

- Added support for architectures that don't have natdynlink

- Search the root according to the rules described in the manual
  instead of always using the current directory

- extended the action language to support common actions without using
  a shell:
  + =(with-stdout-to <file> <DSL>)=
  + =(copy <src> <dst>)=
  ...

- Removed all implicit uses of bash or the system shell. Now one has
  to write explicitely =(bash "...")= or =(system "...")=

- Generate meaningful versions in =META= files

- Strengthen the scope of a package. Jbuilder knows about package
  =foo= only in the sub-tree starting from where =foo.opam= lives

* 0.1.alpha1 (04/12/2016)

(* This module drives the front-end. It opens and parses the input files,
   which yields a number of partial grammars. It joins these grammars, expands
   them to get rid of parameterized nonterminals, and performs reachability
   analysis. This yields a single unified grammar. It then performs type
   inference. This yields the grammar that the back-end works with (often
   through the interface provided by module [Grammar]). *)

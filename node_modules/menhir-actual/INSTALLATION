REQUIREMENTS

You need Objective Caml 4.02 or later, ocamlbuild, and GNU make.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURATION CHOICES

1- PREFIX

The value of the PREFIX variable can be changed to control where the software,
the standard library, and the documentation are stored. These files are copied
to the following places:

  $PREFIX/bin/
  $PREFIX/share/menhir/
  $PREFIX/doc/menhir/

PREFIX must be set when invoking "make all" and "make install" (see below).

2- USE_OCAMLFIND

The support library, MenhirLib, is either installed via ocamlfind or installed
directly in the directory $PREFIX/share/menhir. Installing via ocamlfind is
recommended (and is the default). It requires the "ocamlfind" executable to be
found in the PATH. An explicit choice can be made by setting USE_OCAMLFIND to
"true" or "false" when running "make all" (see below).

3- TARGET

If your machine does not have the native code Objective Caml compiler
(ocamlopt), but does have the bytecode compiler (ocamlc), then you
should define "TARGET=byte" when running "make all" and "make install".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPILATION & INSTALLATION

Compile and install as follows:

       make PREFIX=/usr/local USE_OCAMLFIND=true all
  sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install

(If necessary, adjust PREFIX, USE_OCAMLFIND and TARGET as described above.)

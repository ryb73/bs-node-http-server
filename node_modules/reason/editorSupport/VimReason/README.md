VimReason: Vim support for Reason
=========================================

Configuring Vim Via a Plugin Manager
------------------

If you are using a plugin manager, add a line such as the following
to your `.vimrc` file (or wherever you load bundles). This will
install [vim-reason-loader](https://github.com/reasonml/vim-reason-loader)
which is a tiny plugin that will automatically load the
*real* `VimReason` plugin for you.

```
" If using NeoBundle(recommended)
NeoBundle 'reasonml/vim-reason-loader'

" Or, if using Vundle
Bundle 'reasonml/vim-reason-loader'
```
Install a `Reason` Toolchain.
------------------
If you haven't already began the process of installing `Reason`, follow the
[latest
instructions](https://github.com/facebook/Reason/blob/master/README.md#install-via-npm).


More Details about `vim-reason-loader`
---------------------
`vim-reason-loader` is great because it will always load the editor plugin itself
from wherever `ocamlmerlin` and `refmt` are installed in your `PATH`. That means
that you always have your plugin in sync with your project's dependencies
on Merlin/Reason. If you have to projects that have two different versions of Reason,
then the editing experience will be in sync with the version of Reason you are using
(assuming you ensure your `PATH` contains your project's version of `Reason`).

You should be using a Vim plugin manager like `Vundle`, `NeoBundle` or something else.
If not, skip to the bottom of this doc to configure Vim manually.


Make Vim Awesome:
============

The rest of this document suggests some ways to configure Vim to make the most
of `Reason`, `merlin`, and other editor features.

[VimBox](https://github.com/jordwalke/vimbox) is one great way to get started
with a modern Vim configuration. For example, the plugins it uses will enable
autocompletion when hitting the "." key after module names etc. If building up
your own Vim configuration, you will likely want a good Vim plugin manager such
as [`NeoBundle`](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) or `Vundle`, to
install various plugins. The rest of the docs will assume we're using
`NeoBundle`.

Autocomplete
==========

If you installed `VimBox`, autocomplete is already set up to work like a modern
IDE. Inside of a `.re` file, type `String` followed by a `.` and you will see
the autocomplete window automatically pop up (hit enter to accept). If not
using `VimBox`, Vim makes you press the bizarre key combination (`c-x c-u`) to
trigger autocomplete. As always, make sure to add the right
[Merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin) flags to your `.merlin`
file so that your build artifacts and source files can be found.


Syntastic Integration:
==========

If you installed `VimBox`, Syntastic is already installed and errors will be
underlined in red. If you didn't install `VimBox`, install `Syntastic` by
putting this command in the appropriate place:

```vim
NeoBundle "scrooloose/syntastic"
```

When you save any `.re`/`.rei` file, syntax errors and compile errors will be
shown in the location list window and the lines with errors will be underlined
in red.

Formatting:
===========

The command `:ReasonPrettyPrint` invokes the binary `refmt` which must be
available on your `PATH`.

`VimReason`, doesn't use Vim's standard external formatting program bridge
because it disturbs your undo history and cursor position. Instead,
`VimReason`, implements its own buffer updates so that no modifications to your
buffer occur if the file is already formatted, and only lines requiring updates
are actually modified (so that undo/redo take you to the position where
formatting actually effected the file).

You can set `g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason` to control the arguments
passed to `refmt` (such as `--print-width`). The contents of
`g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason` is a string that contains a `VimScript`
expression. This allows you do dynamically determine the formatting arguments
based on things like your window width.

```vim
" Always wrap at 90 columns
let g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason = '"--print-width 90"'

" Wrap at the window width
let g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason = '"--print-width " . ' .  "winwidth('.')"

" Wrap at the window width but not if it exceeds 120 characters.
let g:vimreason_extra_args_expr_reason = '"--print-width " . ' .  "min([120, winwidth('.')])"
```

Key Mappings:
=============

You can create a custom function and map it to a keybinding (in your `.vimrc`)
to quickly trigger formatting, and control how the formatting occurs. To enable
keymappings *only* for `reason` files, your vim must have been compiled with
`+localmap` (`:echo has('localmap')` should output `1` if your vim supports it).

For example, the following maps `cmd + shift + m` to reformat only when editing
a `reason` file.

```vim
autocmd FileType reason map <buffer> <D-M> :ReasonPrettyPrint<Cr>
```


Merlin:
===========
If you have `merlin` installed, `VimReason` will also activate it for `reason`
files. Completions should work well, but most other things don't. `VimReason`
can't rely on `merlin` compilation, but does scan the `.merlin` file to pick
out flags and include paths so that it can compile individual files and report
compiler errors to syntastic.


Brace Completion:
============
`VimBox` already comes with `PairTools`, but if you don't have `VimBox`, install it using `Vundle`:

```vim
NeoBundle "git://github.com/MartinLafreniere/vim-PairTools.git"
```

Seriously - you should install `PairTools`. It is perhaps the best brace completion plugin for Vim.

Once you have `PairTools`, add this configuration in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_pairclamp = 1
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_tagwrench = 0
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_jigsaw    = 1
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_autoclose  = 1
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_forcepairs = 0
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_closepairs = "(:),[:],{:}" . ',":"'
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_smartclose = 1
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_smartcloserules = '\w,(,&,\*'
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_antimagic  = 1
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_antimagicfield  = "Comment,String,Special"
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_pcexpander = 1
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_pceraser   = 1
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_tagwrenchhook = 'tagwrench#BuiltinNoHook'
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_twexpander = 0
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_tweraser   = 0
autocmd FileType reason let g:pairtools_reason_apostrophe = 0
```

Configuring Vim Manually.
------------------
If you don't use a Vim plugin manager, you can add the following to your
"vim rc" folder (usually `~/.vimrc`). This will load
the `Reason` and `merlin` Vim plugins from `Reason` itself, wherever it is
installed. Normally, you'd load Vim plugins through some kind of a plugin manager,
but this approach below allows the plugins to always be in sync with whatever version of
`Reason` your project (or `PATH`) uses.

```vim
" In your ~/.vimrc
if executable('ocamlmerlin')
  " To set the log file and restart:
  let s:ocamlmerlin=substitute(system('which ocamlmerlin'),'ocamlmerlin\n$','','') . "../share/merlin/vim/"
  execute "set rtp+=".s:ocamlmerlin
  let g:syntastic_ocaml_checkers=['merlin']
endif
if executable('refmt')
  let s:reason=substitute(system('which refmt'),'refmt\n$','','') . "../share/reason/editorSupport/VimReason"
  execute "set rtp+=".s:reason
  let g:syntastic_reason_checkers=['merlin']
endif
```
